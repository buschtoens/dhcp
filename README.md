Low level DHCP server in Node.js

Currently under initial development, so expect things to change.
Join me, if you like. I accept pull requests and work on issues.

A short notice on the current state of development:
I currently can't spare enough time to really continue the work on
this in a professional fashion. However, I've uploaded my most
recent stuff to the [0.1.0 branch](https://github.com/silvinci/dhcp/tree/0.1.0).
